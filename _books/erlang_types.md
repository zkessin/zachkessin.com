Types are a core part of most programming languages. In Erlang we have
strong but dynamic typing, however with pattern matching and post
compile tools like dialyzer it is possible to get many of the benefits
of strong typing in Erlang.

This book will be your guide to understanding how to use types in
Erlang code for the best possible code quality.

It will show you how to setup types, how to use them at both compile
and run time, and how to use pattern matching to ensure that cross
contamination between data types does not happen.

It will guide you threw running dialyzer and understanding what it is
trying to tell you about your code. It will also explain many of the
errors that are produced by dialyzer but which may be hard to
understand.
