# Learn to find more bugs

Unit tests have become a standard part of development processes in the
last few years, but they are limited by the creativity of the
developer to implement interesting test cases. 

What if we were to randomly generate test cases? Could we find the
strange corner cases before we put our system into production?

There is a well developed set of tools for doing this, QuickCheck,
Triq and PropEr will allow you to do just that and find more bugs in
less code.
