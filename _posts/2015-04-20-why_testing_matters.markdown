Having repeatable tests is a key part of having a quality code
base. Without tests there is no way to know if some change that you
may make will break anything else.

Having a quality tests that are run as part of each git commit means
that you know quickly when something breaks.

This also leads to more effective developers, as the team is not afraid to touch anything in case it breaks in some way that is not understood.
