Scale and testing are two of the most difficult problems in computer
programming today.

While we have not reached the end of Moore's law, and we are still
adding more components to chips, our processors are not getting
faster, so our code must get concurrent. Erlang was designed to do
just that, with a model that makes concurrent code easy to write and
actually enjoyable.

However many people are afraid of Erlang, so now I am happy to offer
coaching, training and development around Erlang!
